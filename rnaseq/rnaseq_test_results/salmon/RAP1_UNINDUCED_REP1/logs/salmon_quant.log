[2025-12-04 02:42:37.657] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00411802% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 26.

It is more versatile, exposes more features, and allows considering multi-sample information during aggregation.
